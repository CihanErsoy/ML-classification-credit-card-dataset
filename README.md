# ML-classification-credit-card-dataset
Machine Learning classification implementation on credit card applications dataset. 

This project is a course project on datacamp and implemented to strength my machine learning classificiation skill.

Logistic Regression is chosen to implement classification. 

Label encoding, scaling features, replacing question marks with Nan, filling null values with the most frequent element, dropping null values techniques can be found throught the project.

A lot of datapreprocessing technique samples can be found. 

Hyper parameter tuning optimization is used to find best parameters. Accuracy score is improved from 0.842 to 0.853 with the help of optimization.
